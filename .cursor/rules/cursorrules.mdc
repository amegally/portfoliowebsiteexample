# Cursor Rules for Portfolio Website

## Tech Stack Requirements
- Backend: Node.js (Vanilla)
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (No frameworks)
- Email: Built-in Node.js mailer functionality
- Storage: File-based (JSON for data, local storage for images)

## Rules for Making Changes

1. **README First**
   - Always check README.md before making any changes
   - Review the implementation plan in README.md to ensure changes align with the current phase
   - Verify which tasks are completed and which are pending

2. **After Making Changes**
   - Update README.md to reflect any completed tasks
   - Mark tasks as complete using [x] in the implementation plan
   - Add any new tasks that were identified during implementation
   - Document any important decisions or changes in the Development Notes section

3. **Code Organization**
   - Follow the project structure defined in README.md
   - Keep all static assets in the public directory
   - Maintain separation of concerns between views and server logic
   - Keep partials (header/footer) in the views/partials directory

4. **Documentation Requirements**
   - All major changes must be documented in README.md
   - New features must be added to the Features section
   - Technical changes must be reflected in the Tech Stack section
   - Update Getting Started guide if setup steps change

5. **Quality Control**
   - Ensure changes maintain the "vanilla" approach (no frameworks)
   - Test responsive design after UI changes
   - Verify dynamic header/footer functionality remains intact
   - Check that project filtering still works after changes

6. **Progress Tracking**
   - Use checkboxes in README.md to track progress
   - Update phase status in implementation plan
   - Document any blockers or issues in Development Notes
   - Keep the implementation plan up to date

Remember: The README.md is our source of truth for the project's current state and future direction. Always refer to it and keep it updated.
